###Instruction:
Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text function block BURNER with following functionality. BURNER is a control interface for oil or gas burner operating at kilowatt hour meter and counter. The module controls a two-stage burner with optional fuel oil warming. The input IN is the control input that starts the burner only when the input OVER_TEMP is FALSE. OVER_TEMP is the boiler thermostat protection, which gets TRUE, if the boiler temperature has reached the maximum temperature. A burner start begins with the fuel oil warming, by PRE_HEAT gets TRUE. Then it waits for a signal at the input OIL_TEMP. If the signal OIL_TEMP is within the PRE_HEAT_TIME not TRUE and the oil temperature is not reached, the start sequence is interrupted and the output FAIL is set to TRUE. At the same time the error is spent at the Output STATUS. After fuel oil warming the motor gets on and sets the fan in operation. Then after a defned time the ignition is switched and the oil valve is opened. If no response of the fame sensor after specifed time (SAFETY_TIME), the module shows a failure. A fault is signaled even if the fame sensor responds before the ignition. If after a successful ignition, the fame breaks of and the set-variable MULTIPLE_IGNITION = TRUE, immediately a ignition is started. A second stage is activated automatically after the time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STASTAGE2 time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAILockout STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAILockout STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAILockout STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAGE time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAILockout STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STASTAGE_time STAME time STAME time STAME time STAME time STA
