IEC 61131-3 - Structured Text Program of a Crane

Program Title: Load Receptors on a Crane

Author(s): Unknown

Date: Unknown

Description: The purpose of this task is to replace as many fixed numerical values as possible from the declaration and program code with constants. 

The program will contain a FOR loop which will iterate through each load receptoor and calculate the total load, the average value and the sum of all loads. It will also use a switch statement to determine which type of input is being used and assign the appropriate values to the variables. The program code will be structured in such a way that it can be easily modified and adapted for different types of inputs.
