Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text program with an interlock functionality. The code has 2 inputs I1 and I2, which respectively switch the outputs Q1 and Q2. However, Q1 and Q2 are mutually locked so that only one output can be set to TRUE. The time TL determines a dead time between the two outputs. An output can only become TRUE if the other output was FALSE for at least the time TL.
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
FUNCTION_BLOCK INTERLOCK
    VAR_INPUT
        I1 : BOOL;
        I2 : BOOL;
        TL : TIME;
    END_VAR
    VAR_OUTPUT
        Q1 : BOOL;
        Q2 : BOOL;
    END_VAR
    VAR
        T1 : TOF;
        T2 : TOF;
    END_VAR
