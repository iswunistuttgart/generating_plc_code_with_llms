Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text program of a crane. There are five load receptors on one crane. The load receptors are each connected to an analog input and provide values from 0 to 32767. To determine the total load and the average value, the individual loads must first be added together and divided by the number of load receptors. Solve the task using a FOR loop. As a result of the previous task, the sum of the individual loads could be calculated using a loop. So far, the variable declaration and the program code contain fixed numerical values. The purpose of this task is to replace as many fixed numerical values as possible from the declaration and program code with constants.
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
VAR CONSTANT
    MAX_INDEX: USINT := 4;
END_VAR
VAR
    aWeights : ARRAY[0..MAX_INDEX] OF INT;
    iCnt : USINT;
    sumWeight : DINT;
    avgWeight : INT;
END_VAR
