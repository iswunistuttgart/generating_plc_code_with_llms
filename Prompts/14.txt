Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text function FC1001 with the following functionality. Depending on the constantly changing measured values of a sensor, an output should be switched on when a certain predeterminable switching value is exceeded and switched off when it falls below a certain predetermined switching value using a function FC 1001. In order to prevent possible switching back and forth (fluttering) at the switching value, a switching hysteresis in % of the switching value is specified at another function input. The measured values have the REAL data format thanks to a conversion function
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
FUNCTION FC1001 :BOOL
VAR_INPUT
	MEW: REAL;
	SP: REAL;
	HYS: REAL;
END_VAR
VAR_IN_OUT
 	OUT:BOOL;
END_VAR
VAR
 	P_HYS: REAL;
END_VAR
