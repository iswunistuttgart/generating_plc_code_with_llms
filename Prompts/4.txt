Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text program of a fill level check. The fill level in a container should be monitored in three ranges: low, ok and high. Use one output each for low, ok and high. The fill level is read in via an analog value (0 - 32767) and should be should be converted internally to 0-100%. If the content falls below 1%, a warning horn should sound. Solve this application by using the CASE instruction.
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
VAR
    aiLevel : INT;
    PercentLevel : UINT;
    doLow : BOOL;
    doOk : BOOL;
    doHigh : BOOL;
    doAlarm : BOOL;
END_VAR
