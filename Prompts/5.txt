Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text program of a Gate Controller. The variable One_Hour_Timer should start counting when Start_Loop is FALSE and it will time out after 1 hour of counting. If the timer timed out and the Gate is still open it should close. If it senses the app or the car and the Auth string matches my_defined_str the gate should open.
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
VAR
    Start_Loop : BOOL := FALSE;
    one_hour : TIME := T#1h;
    One_Hour_Timer : TON;
    Gate_Open : BOOL := FALSE;
    Close_Gate_Inst : BOOL := FALSE;
    Sensed_Car : BOOL := FALSE;
    Sensed_Car_Inst : BOOL := FALSE;
    Sensed_App : BOOL := FALSE;
    Mobile_Inst : BOOL := FALSE;
    Auth : STRING;
    my_defined_str : STRING := 'abcd';
END_VAR
