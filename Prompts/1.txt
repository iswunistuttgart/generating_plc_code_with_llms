Give me an IEC 61131-3 structured text program with two alarms represented by the variables xAlarm1 and xAlarm2. With the signal xAllOn all alarms should be set to TRUE and the signal should be turned off. With the signal xAllOff all alarms should be set to FALSE and the signal should be turned off.
Following rules should be followed:
- variables should be declared between VAR and END_VAR
- when using control structures do not forget END_<controll structure>
- switch cases should be avoided unless instructed in the task
- use the right quotation marks for the string type
- implementing a function should be avoided
- only when implementing a function: the variables should be declared inside the function; the return value should be stored in a variable named after the function; RETURN should be used correctly, to return to the main method and not to return a value
Only following variables should be used:
VAR
	xAllOn : BOOL;
	xAllOff : BOOL;

	xAlarm1 : BOOL;
    xAlarm2 : BOOL;
END_VAR
